# Hotel bookings analysis
Led a capstone project on hotel booking data, performing data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (Pandas, NumPy) by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and engineering new features.

Conducted exploratory data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify trends in lead time, stay duration, and guest behavior patterns.

Detected and addressed skewed distributions and outliers, enhancing the reliability of business insights and improving model readiness.

Documented the complete analysis workflow on GitHub, showcasing skills in data wrangling, visualization, and professional analytical reporting.
